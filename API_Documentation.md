# API Documentation

## Base URL

```
http://localhost:3001/api
```

## Important: Timezone Handling

**All date and time values are stored and returned in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).**

- All timestamps in responses use ISO 8601 format with the "Z" suffix (e.g., `2025-11-03T09:00:00.000Z`)
- The "Z" suffix explicitly indicates UTC timezone
- **The backend never converts times to any local timezone**
- **The client/frontend is responsible for converting UTC times to the user's local timezone for display**

### How User Timezones Work

When a user signs up, they provide their timezone as a UTC offset (e.g., `"+05:30"` for India/IST, `"-08:00"` for US Pacific):

- The user's working hours are fixed at **9 AM - 5 PM in their local time**
- The backend converts these local hours to UTC for slot generation and storage
- Example: An Indian user with timezone `"+05:30"`:
  - Local working hours: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM IST
  - Converted to UTC: 3:30 AM - 11:30 AM UTC
  - All slots are generated and stored in this UTC time range

This approach ensures:

- Consistent data storage regardless of server location
- No timezone conversion errors on the backend
- Flexibility for clients to display times in any timezone
- Accurate handling of daylight saving time changes
- Each user's slots align with their local working hours

## Authentication

Authentication is required only for:

- User profile endpoints (`/api/users/me`)
- Regenerating sharableId (`POST /api/users/me/regenerate-sharable-id`)
- Editing appointments (`PATCH /api/appointments/:id`)
- Deleting appointments (`DELETE /api/appointments/:id`)

Authentication uses JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies named `token`.

### Headers for Authenticated Requests

```
Content-Type: application/json
Cookie: token=<jwt_token>
```

## Authentication Endpoints

### POST /auth/signup

Create a new user account and automatically generate initial slots for the entire current month.

### Date/Time Format

All dates and times are in ISO 8601 format in UTC timezone:

**Key Points:**

- The "Z" suffix indicates UTC timezone (zero offset from UTC)
- All times are stored in UTC on the backend
- No timezone conversions are performed by the API
- Clients must convert to local timezone for display if needed
- Example: `2025-11-03T09:00:00.000Z` represents 9:00 AM UTC, which is 2:30 PM IST (UTC+5:30)

---

## Rate Limiting

Currently, there is no rate limiting implemented. Consider implementing rate limiting in production.

---

## CORS

CORS is enabled for the frontend URL specified in the `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable (default: `http://localhost:5173`).

Allowed methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `OPTIONS`

Credentials (cookies) are supported.

---

- Emails are sent from `appointments@resend.dev`
- Only guests/attendees receive emails (not the calendar owner who makes the change)

---

## Key Features

### sharableId-Based Access

- Users share their `sharableId` (UUID) to allow others to book appointments
- No authentication required for viewing/booking
- sharableId can be regenerated for security

### What Requires Auth

- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user info
- `GET /api/users/me` - Get user profile
- `POST /api/users/me/regenerate-sharable-id` - Regenerate sharableId
- `PATCH /api/appointments/:id` - Edit/reschedule appointment
- `DELETE /api/appointments/:id` - Delete appointment

### What Doesn't Require Auth

- Viewing appointments (with sharableId)
- Viewing slots (with sharableId) - returns both booked and available
- Booking appointments (with sharableId)

## Notes

### Fixed Schedule

- All users have the same fixed schedule: **Monday-Friday, 9 AM - 5 PM (UTC)**
- All slot times are **30 minutes** in duration
- No custom availability settings - schedule is fixed for all users

### Slot Generation

- Slots are automatically generated for new users (entire current month)
- Slots are generated weekly for all users (every Sunday at 00:00)
- Past unbooked slots are automatically cleaned up daily (02:00)

### Appointments

- Appointments use soft deletion (isDeleted flag)
- When an appointment is deleted, the associated slot becomes available again
- All times are stored and returned in UTC

### Security

- sharableId is a UUID that can be shared publicly
- sharableId can be regenerated by the user for security purposes
- Regenerating sharableId effectively revokes all previous sharing links
